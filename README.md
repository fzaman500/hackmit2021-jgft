# hackmit2021-jgft
HackMIT 2021 Finalist &amp; Education Track Winner. Tracks a video feed for specific hand signs that map to presentation controls in order to simplify the logistics of teachers' presentations.

Check out our presentation - located inside the Demo folder and named "JGFT PRESENTATION - HACKMIT 2021.pdf" - to learn more about what we did.


**The Vision**

Many teachers (pre- and post-COVID) struggle to hold everything they need when presenting at the board. They juggle and subsequently drop multiple expo markers, notes, a presentation clicker, etc. Running to a side table to deposit things or advance slides breaks the flow of the lecture, and struggling to carry everything leaves teachers focusing on the logistics instead of actually being able to teach their students. My team realized that, especially after COVID-19, each classroom already is equipped with a camera and video-recording capabilities, and used those to help solve this problem. We strove to create an extension that can run on any computer and monitors a video stream waiting for a presenter to make a pre-set hand sign, such as a fist or flat palm towards the camera. Each hand sign triggers an action to be executed when detected, such as advancing a slide, rewinding, playing a video, etc; this allows teachers to ditch clickers and leaves them with one less thing to juggle while presenting.
